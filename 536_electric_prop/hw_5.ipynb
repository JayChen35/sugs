    "The ideal propellant is one that has a large ionization cross section while still being light. Given constant input power this would maximize all the above performance metrics, however this is generally not possible to achieve. As we've learned generally from this class, maximizing specific impulse by having the lightest exhaust species is not always optimal in EP systems due to engineering considerations (e.g. heavy power systems).\n",

    "Xenon is typically the propellant of choice due to a combination of performance and engineering variables. Noble gases are generally preferable for the lifetime of stage and engine systems, and it is the heaviest noble gas, meaning it can achieve the highest thrust density (smaller engine packaging) and beam utilization has seen above. Mass utilization scales linearly with $m_i$ instead of by $\\sqrt{m_i}$, so the efficiency gain of Xenon is very decent. It is also very dense and a gas at room temperature, meaning a lot of mass can be carried in a small volume. The Szabo paper also mentions that its ionization energy is lower, which means for a given electron mean free path, it will lose less energy (and therefore stay in the channel longer) when colliding with Xenon. The largest drawback of Xenon is generally just its high monetary cost."

    "The plot we get there is evidently not physical, but this is the whole problem of anomalous transport; given only classical theory of transport mechanisms, we overestimate the Hall term and therefore the gradient of the electric field is much greater than what it should be. A reasonable potential drop will be in the tens or hundreds of V, not thousands."
