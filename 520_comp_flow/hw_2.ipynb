The gas mixture is initially at rest in a long tube until a shock wave moving at $W$ = 2000 m/s sweeps through it.\n",

Thus, given this thermal bath assumption, we will only evaluate the relaxation time scale for coefficients of oxygen-argon collisions (as provided in lecture). We first solve for an initial $(p,T)$ state immediately after the shock (see Part (b) below), solve for $\\tau_v$ in the equation above, and then determine how many multiples of $1/e$ it takes to reach 1% of the final equilibrium."
